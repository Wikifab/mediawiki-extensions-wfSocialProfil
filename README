that you are experiencing currently.


==Customisation fields User Profile==

To change the number of custom fields, set variable wgSocialProfileNbCustomCustomFields to a value between 5 and 11 :
 $wgSocialProfileNbCustomCustomFields = 6;

The last field is using select box, and can be customized like this :
 $wgSocialProfileCustomFields = array (
 		"custom_12" => array (
 				'Jardinage',
 				'Sport',
 				'Cinema',
 				'Voiture',
 				'Moto',
 				'Voyage'
 		) 
 );
 
 You had to create several Mediawiki pages for each value you need in your 12 custom field. 
 For instance, with the above array you need : 
 MediaWiki:Custom_info_field12_Jardinage, which contains the value you need (jardinage)
 MediaWiki:Custom_info_field12_Sport (Sport) ...
 
 
 Moreover, you can use an another custom field with checkboxes and a system of parent/child but this time it's using a Property instead
 of Mediawiki pages. In your wiki you create a Property:Name_of_Property_Page and add your checkboxes' titles like this : 
 
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1A / Name_level 2A / Name_level 3A ]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1A / Name_level 2A / Name_level 3B]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1A / Name_level 2B / Name_level 3A ]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1A / Name_level 2B / Name_level 3B ]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1B / Name_level 2A / Name_level 3A ]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1B / Name_level 2A / Name_level 3B ]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1B / Name_level 2B / Name_level 3A ]]
* [[Allows value:: Name_level 1B / Name_level 2B / Name_level 3B ]]

In your LocalSettings file add this line :
$property_name='Name_of_Property_Page';

Also if you don't want to use custom 13 or cutom 12 , do not put anything in your LocalSettings file. And you won't have any error's 
 display. 


 ==To allow people sending messages==
 
 To allow connected users to send messages you had to add this line in your LocalSettings.php file :
 
 $wgGroupPermissions['user']['userboard-sendMessage']= true;
